# Apple Stock Price Prediction: Hybrid Machine Learning Approach

# Overview

This project aims to predict the short-term closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock using a hybrid machine learning model. By combining a traditional Linear Regression model with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on the residuals, the project seeks to capture both linear and nonlinear patterns in the time series data. The goal is to evaluate whether this hybrid approach can outperform standalone models in forecasting stock price movements.

# Objective
Build a hybrid model for short-term prediction of Appleâ€™s closing stock price.

Combine Linear Regression (for linear trends) and LSTM (for nonlinear, sequential patterns).

Assess whether the hybrid model outperforms individual models.

# Data
Source: Historical daily price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL).

# Features: 

Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.

# Preprocessing:

Dates parsed to datetime format.

Data sorted by date.

Missing values handled as needed.

Features scaled using MinMaxScaler for neural network compatibility.

# Project Workflow

Data Loading

Import CSV data and parse dates.

Sort and reset index for time series continuity.

Data Cleaning

Check for and handle missing values.

Visualize data trends and distributions.

Feature Engineering

Select relevant features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

Scale features for LSTM input.

Model Development

Linear Regression: Fit model to capture linear patterns in closing prices.

LSTM: Train on Linear Regression residuals to model nonlinear dependencies.

Hybrid Model Construction

Combine Linear Regression predictions with LSTM predictions on residuals to generate final forecast.

Model Evaluation

Compare hybrid model performance with standalone Linear Regression and LSTM models using standard regression metrics.

# Modeling Approach
Linear Regression: Captures overall trend and linear relationships in the data.

LSTM Neural Network: Models complex, nonlinear, and sequential dependencies in the residuals left by the Linear Regression.

Hybrid Model: Final prediction is the sum of Linear Regression output and LSTM-predicted residuals, leveraging strengths of both approaches.

Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

These metrics are used to assess and compare the predictive accuracy of each model component and the hybrid model.

Results
The hybrid model demonstrates improved accuracy over standalone models by effectively capturing both linear and nonlinear patterns in the stock price data.

Visualizations and error metrics are provided in the notebook to illustrate performance gains.
